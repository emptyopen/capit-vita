# capit-vita

A project that takes historical financial data (currently from alphavangtage, previously from Yahoo Finance / Quandl) and screens signals based on technical analysis. Also connects to a Robinhood (and Bittrex account) to make trades autonomously. 

I started a $250 option experimental project that in one year is now valued at ~$7000.
